This blog is generated using a language model (LLM) that transcribes my recorded audio in Japanese. Once I have accumulated a sufficient amount of data (approximately one year), I plan to publish a dataset that will include:

- Speech recordings (10-20 minutes each)
- Machine-generated transcriptions
- Hand-corrected transcriptions
- LLM-generated blog posts
- Revised versions of the blog posts
