# What I use to build this blog

I'm using the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to build this page. For the web design, I'm using the [Vuepress-hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/) in combination with Vuepress.

Once we setup everything, all we need is to write a markdown, and the Vuepress-hope will automatically recognize tags and categories, and format the documents.
Switching from English to Japanese is also done by Vuepress-hope.
I think this is a pretty nice feature.

I usually write these blogs in Japanese, which is my mother tongue, and transcribe by my self, and revised by LLM such as ChatGPT.
Well, I need to practice my English skill...
