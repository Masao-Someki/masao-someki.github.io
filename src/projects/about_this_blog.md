# What I Use to Build This Blog

I'm using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to build this blog, along with the [VuePress-Hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/) theme for web design.

Once everything is set up, all I need to do is write in Markdown, and VuePress-Hope automatically recognizes tags and categories, formatting the documents accordingly. It also seamlessly switches between English and Japanese, which I find to be a particularly useful feature.

I usually write these blog posts in Japanese, my native language, transcribe them myself, and then refine them with the help of language models like ChatGPT. Although I rely on these tools, I know I still need to practice my English skills!
