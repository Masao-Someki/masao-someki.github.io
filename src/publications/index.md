I'd like to explain about the research I've been get in touch with.

- [A Comparative Study on Transformer vs RNN in Speech Applications](./rnn_vs_transformer.md): The comparison of RNN based models and Transformer based models on Speech to text task.
- [ESPnet-ONNX: Bridging a Gap Between Research and Production](./espnet_onnx.md): A software to convert pre-trained model of ESPnet into ONNX.
- [Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference](./partially_autoregressive_inference.md): This proposes a decoding process that combines the autoregressive and non-autoregressive process. We improved trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.
