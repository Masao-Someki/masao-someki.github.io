For instance, we predict the second e only after predicting the first s, utilizing the information that the first letter of this audio is s. This method yields high accuracy but is slow because each token must wait for the previous ones to be computed.</p><h3 id="what-is-non-autoregressive-decoding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-non-autoregressive-decoding"><span>What is Non-Autoregressive decoding?</span></a></h3><p>The main drawback of AR decoding is its slow inference speed. To address this, Non-Autoregressive (NAR) decoding attempts to predict all tokens simultaneously.</p><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="Non-Autoregressive decoding" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Non-Autoregressive decoding</figcaption></figure><p>There are several architectures for NAR decoding. In my work, I chose to use Mask-CTC, one of the simpler NAR structures. Initially, the CTC module serves as a NAR estimator, predicting all characters at once. Since CTC predicts tokens for each frame independently, it qualifies as non-autoregressive decoding. However, this lack of dependency across frames leads to lower accuracy compared to AR. To improve this, Mask-CTC replaces low-confidence tokens with a decoder trained on a Masked Language Model task.</p><p>This process is faster than AR because it allows parallel prediction of characters, but it comes at the cost of some accuracy loss. For example, token length cannot be adjusted even if the CTC output is longer or shorter than the actual string sequence.</p><h3 id="what-is-partially-autoregressive-decoding-we-propose" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-partially-autoregressive-decoding-we-propose"><span>What is Partially Autoregressive decoding we propose</span></a></h3><p>In our paper, we propose revising the low-confidence tokens from the CTC module using AR. This means that only part of the sequence is predicted in an AR manner, reducing the number of iterations required for AR processing. This is why we call it Partially Autoregressive (PAR) decoding.</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="Partially Autoregressive decoding" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Partially Autoregressive decoding</figcaption></figure><p>By revising the low-confidence tokens (marked in red) in parallel, the number of AR iterations can be significantly reduced. When revising the second or later parts, each segment for the AR process contains these low-confidence tokens. While we could wait for the first part to be predicted, doing so would slow down inference. Therefore, in our paper, we utilized the CTC output even if it might contain incorrect tokens. Our experiments showed no significant difference in accuracy when directly employing the CTC output.</p><p>We computed the low-confidence tokens in parallel, reducing the number of AR iterations to the same as if there were only a single low-confidence token in the sequence. This parallelization of the AR process is the core technique that enables the fast and accurate inference presented in our paper.</p><h2 id="experimental-result" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#experimental-result"><span>Experimental Result</span></a></h2><h3 id="ar-vs-par" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ar-vs-par"><span>AR vs PAR</span></a></h3><p>For evaluating error, we used the Word Error Rate (WER).</p><figure><img src="'+o+'" alt="Table 3" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Table 3</figcaption></figure><p>The results show that PAR significantly speeds up inference without sacrificing much accuracy.

By removing this redundant tensor copy, the memory issue was resolved, and inference was further improved.</p>',37),h=[p];function g(u,m){return a(),t("div",null,h)}const y=e(d,[["render",g],["__file","partially_autoregressive_inference.html.vue"]]),b=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/publications/partially_autoregressive_inference.html","title":"Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"pen-fancy","category":["publications"],"tag":["inference","decode","AR","NAR","PAR"],"description":"Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference arXiv Abstract By combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding, we develo...","head":[["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"ja-jp","href":"https://Masao-Someki.github.io/ja/publications/partially_autoregressive_inference.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://Masao-Someki.github.io/publications/partially_autoregressive_inference.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Masao's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference arXiv Abstract By combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding, we develo..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"ja-JP"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-08-11T17:48:35.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Masao Someki"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"inference"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"decode"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"AR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"NAR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"PAR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-08-11T17:48:35.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Segment-Level Vectorized Beam Search Based on Partially Autoregressive Inference\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-08-11T17:48:35.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Masao Someki\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://Masao-Someki.github.io\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Abstract","slug":"abstract","link":"#abstract","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Details on PAR","slug":"details-on-par","link":"#details-on-par","children":[{"level":3,"title":"What is Autoregressive decoding?","slug":"what-is-autoregressive-decoding","link":"#what-is-autoregressive-decoding","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"What is Non-Autoregressive decoding?","slug":"what-is-non-autoregressive-decoding","link":"#what-is-non-autoregressive-decoding","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"What is Partially Autoregressive decoding we propose","slug":"what-is-partially-autoregressive-decoding-we-propose","link":"#what-is-partially-autoregressive-decoding-we-propose","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Experimental Result","slug":"experimental-result","link":"#experimental-result","children":[{"level":3,"title":"AR vs PAR","slug":"ar-vs-par","link":"#ar-vs-par","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Trade-off","slug":"trade-off","link":"#trade-off","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"NAR vs PAR","slug":"nar-vs-par","link":"#nar-vs-par","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Limitation","slug":"limitation","link":"#limitation","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Accuracy","slug":"accuracy","link":"#accuracy","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"About the memory usage","slug":"about-the-memory-usage","link":"#about-the-memory-usage","children":[]}]}],"git":{"createdTime":1723351165000,"updatedTime":1723398515000,"contributors":[{"name":"Masao-Someki","email":"masao.someki@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.63,"words":790},"filePathRelative":"publications/partially_autoregressive_inference.md","localizedDate":"August 11, 2024","excerpt":"\\n<p><a href=\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14922\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">arXiv</a></p>\\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\\n<p>By combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding, we developed a partially autoregressive (PAR) approach that leverages the strengths of both methods.
