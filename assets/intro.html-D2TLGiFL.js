However, these models typically contain a large number of parameters, which can slow down inference speed in speech processing systems. My research aims to develop new techniques that allow these large models to operate efficiently on resource-constrained environments, without compromising on accuracy or inference speed.</p><p><strong>[SLU] Speech-to-Text Understanding: Generating Structured Text from Speech</strong></p><p>During my time at IBM Japan, I recognized the importance of generating structured text from conversations, especially in a streaming manner. This capability could have wide-ranging applications in business, such as generating meeting minutes, to-do lists, or summarizing key action points from discussions.</p><p>While there are existing services that combine Speech-to-Text and Large Language Models to achieve similar outcomes, I am interested in exploring the development of an end-to-end streaming model that can accomplish this task more efficiently and accurately.</p>',10),i=[r];function s(c,h){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const p=e(o,[["render",s],["__file","intro.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/intro.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"circle-info","bgImage":"/assets/images/tonarino.png","description":"Self-Introduction Short Bio I majored in Statistics at the School of Economics, Nagoya University, following my high school graduation.
